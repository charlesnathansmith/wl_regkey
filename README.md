# WinLicense 2.x, 3.x Registration Key File Format Demo

Demonstrates how WL registration file keys are constructed from hash and keys generated at protection time.

See [regkey_format.pdf](https://github.com/charlesnathansmith/wl_regkey/blob/main/regkey_format.pdf) for full explanation of everything happening here.

This all was constructed by reverse engineering their freely available key generation binaries.

Nothing contained herein has any affiliation with WinLicense or Oreans, and none of this can be used to bypass licensing in protected programs as this works off of private keys generated at protection time.

This is simply an exploration of a really interesting file format with multiple layers of encryption that I haven't seen thoroughly covered anywhere else.
